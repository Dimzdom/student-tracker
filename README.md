# Student Tracker

I made this for teachers to track student warnings. It's all in one html file, so it's super lightweight.

## How to use it:
Just open index.html in your browser.
1. Enter your student names.
2. Click Start Class.
3. Add sticky notes for each student whenever you need to.

Everything gets saved in your browser (local storage), so you won't lose your data if you refresh or close the tab.
